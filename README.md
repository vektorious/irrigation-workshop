# Irrigation Workshop

## Introduction
In this workshop, we will build an automated plant watering system. It will consist of three key components:
1. Sensor – measures soil moisture
2. Pump – delivers water to the plant
3. Controller – reads sensor data and controls the pump

Together, these parts create a responsive system that waters a plant only when it needs it.

## Soil Moisture Sensors

### Overview

| Sensor Type      | Measurement Principle                    | Advantages                  | Limitations                                    |
|------------------|------------------------------------------|-----------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| Capacitive       | Measures dielectric constant of the soil | Durable, accurate           | Sensitive to nearby objects and interference   |
| Resistive        | Measures electrical resistance           | Cheap, easy to use          | Corrodes over time                             |

In addition to resistive and capacitive sensors, there are more advanced methods used in agriculture and research, such as tensiometers, Time Domain Reflectometry or Frequency Domain Reflectometry TDR/FDR sensors, and thermal or capillary-based systems. These offer higher accuracy or different measurement principles (like soil water tension) but are often more complex or expensive.

### DIY Sensors

Tension Sensors (e.g. Tensiometer, Capillary Sensor)
- Measure how tightly water is held in the soil.
- Simulate what plants "feel" when extracting water.
- Use porous ceramic tips and water-filled tubes to show suction or pressure changes.
- analog output but requires pressure sensor to read electronically -> fun but complex to integrate.

Resistive Sensors (e.g. Nail Electrodes, Gypsum Block)
- Measure electrical resistance between two conductors.
- Moist soil conducts better, dry soil worse (but soil type/quality has an impact too!).
- Simple to build with nails, wires, or embedded in gypsum for more stability.
- analog output (voltage) which is very easy to read with microcontrollers -> simple and easy to integrate.

Tensiometers provide more biologically meaningful data, but are harder to read electronically. Resistive sensors are easier to connect and automate, making them ideal for basic watering systems.

## Pump Systems

| Pump Type         | Working Principle                             | Advantages                        | Suitable For                     |
|-------------------|-----------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|----------------------------------|
| Submersible Pump  | Impeller submerged in water reservoir         | High flow rate, robust            | Raised beds, greenhouses         |
| Diaphragm Pump    | Oscillating membrane creates pressure/vacuum  | Stable pressure, self-priming     | Distributed watering systems     |
| Peristaltic Pump  | Fluid pushed through flexible tube by rollers | Precise dosage, no backflow       | Potted plants, indoor setups     |


## Controlling the Pump

Microcontrollers like ESP32 or Arduinos cannot power pumps directly. You need an electronic switch that can handle higher current. There are two common ways to do this: Using a relay or a MOSFET.

| Feature                  | Relay Module                            | MOSFET Module                               |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| Switching type           | Mechanical (electromagnetic switch)     | Electronic (transistor-based)               |
| Sound                    | Audible “click” when switching          | Silent                                      |
| Speed                    | Slow switching (ms range)               | Fast switching (μs range), suitable for PWM |
| Load types               | Good for AC and DC                      | Typically used for DC only                  |
| Efficiency               | Some power loss (mechanical contact)    | High efficiency, low heat generation        |
| Use case example         | Simple on/off pump control              | Precise or PWM pump control (e.g. speed)    |
| Complexity               | Easy to wire and understand             | Requires correct polarity and pin setup     |

For this workshop, we have these available:
- Regular microcontroller-ready relay modules
- MOSFET (IRLB8721PbF) suitable for switching upt to 24V DC and 10A (Wiring example check [here](https://learn.adafruit.com/rgb-led-strips/usage))


## Reading Sensor Data

```python
from machine import Pin, ADC
from time import sleep

soil = ADC(Pin(26))

while True:
  soil_value = soil.read_u16() # read value, 0-65535 across voltage range 0.0v - 3.3v
  print((soil_value/65535)*3.3)
  sleep(1)

```
